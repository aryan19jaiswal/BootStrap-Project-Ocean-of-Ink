# BootStrap-Project-Ocean-of-Ink
Hello, This is Aryan. 
This is my project to practice and revise my newly learnt Bootstrap concepts. 
In this project, I have used Bootstrap to implement my Navbar, Footer or any other thing you see. 
Anybody who is currently learning Bootstrap and want to practice the concepts, then projects are the best way to do the same.

If you want to practice too, then follow the below steps:-
1. First Look at GOAL-1.png, GOAL-2.png, GOAL-3.png and GOAL-4.png respectively.
2. According to that type your code and visit official Bootstrap website to use bootstrap components.
3. I have uploaded images(png & svg both) that you are going to use in the project.
4. If you were successful in achieving the goal, then its good otherwise look at my codes and solve your doubts and practice again.

NOTE: Do not use primary CSS concepts as this project is solely based on practising Bootstrap.
